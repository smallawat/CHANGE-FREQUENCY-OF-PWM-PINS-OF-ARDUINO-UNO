# CHANGE-FREQUENCY-OF-PWM-PINS-OF-ARDUINO-UNO
There is a certain default frequency for each PWM pin, which is called when the analogWrite command is used on that pin. This default frequency can be changed to a value as high as 65Khz and as low as 30Hz by using just one line code”.
Arduino Uno is one of the most commonly used Development board these days. It can be used for almost any application. One such application is in high-frequency circuits. Now there are many facts about Arduino with which many students are not familiar.One of the facts is this: ” There is a certain default frequency for each PWM pin, which is called when the analogWrite command is used on that pin. This default frequency can be changed to a value as high as 65Khz and as low as 30Hz by using just one line code
